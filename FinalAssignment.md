Mid-point Check-in: April 9, 2018 (discussion with Dr. Erhardt)

Final Presentations: April 25, 2018

Final Report Due: May 3, 2017, 5 pm in OHR 261

**Assignment**

The final assignment for this class is to apply the skills you learn in this class to analyze a data set and learn something about the transportation system.  The range of topics is wide open, so pick something you are interested in.  It should broadly meet the following criteria: 

1. It should involve writing software using the skills you learn in this class (hacking skills). 
2. It should be defensible from a statistical/data analysis perspective (math & statistics knowledge). 
3. It provide insight to address an important transportation question (substantive expertise). Have a point!

This should put you at the center of the Data Science Venn Diagram.  

Undergraduate students will complete the work as a group, and graduate students individually.  

To make sure you have selected an appropriate topic, you will do a 5-minute oral proposal, followed by a question and answer session.  All students should come prepared to ask constructive questions of all proposers.  You must discuss your idea with Dr. Erhardt during office hours, prior to the proposal.  The proposal must include deliverable #1.  

A mid-point check is is due no as noted above.  You  must review your code and progress with Dr. Erhardt during office hours.  You should come prepared with a work breakdown structure showing the remaining steps.  

The deliverables should include:

1. A clear articulation of the problem you are trying to gain insight into, and the data and methods you will use to gain that insight, and what you expect it to show.    
2. Software that a third-party (Dr. Erhardt) can run and can follow, along with associated input data and parameters, aimed at addressing #1.    
3. Data summaries, visualizations, and/or statistical models that are output from the software, that directly address #1.
4. A narrative, in the form of a power point slides and a presentation, that clearly walk the audience through #1 and #3, using the outputs produced by #2.  

You are encouraged to ask questions and discuss preliminary results along the way.  It is best to get feedback early and avoid surprises!   

**Graduate Students**

Graduate students must also deliver: 

5. A written research report.  The report should be no more than 7500 words, and should follow the Transportation Research Board manuscript format: http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/AM/InfoForAuthors.pdf.  It should include a proper literature review defining the need to solve the problem, include a discussion of the data, methods, results and conclusions, as well as identify limitations and next steps.  

**Code Reviews**

We will follow a code-review model of collaboration in this class.  This means that one person will write a section of code, and a second person will review it to make sure that 1) they can run the code, 2) they understand it, and 3) it is reasonably clean and well-documented.  For example, methods should include API definitions for what each argument is, and what the method returns.  "Magic numbers" should be avoided, and variables and methods should be given logical names.  

Code reviews should be done by directly editing the code, by adding comments, or by creating "issues" in github.  Github check-ins will be used as a means of documenting code reviews, documenting the changes in response to code reviews, and ensuring that sufficient time is allocated to allow for reviews.  

Grading will be such that 90% of the project grade is based on the student's own work, and 10% is based on the grade of the project you are reviewing.  For undergraduates who are completing the work in pairs, students will review their partner's code.  10% of the grade is reserved for the quality of the reviews and general teamwork components.  

**Writing Reviews**

Writing should be reviewed and edited in a manner similar to code reviews. The person writing it should give it to their reviewer to read and comment on before submitting.  The reviewer should expect that they are able to read the document and understand the point of the paper.  They can suggest edits directly, or provide general comments and discussion.
